So we are looking for places to live in the area. I work in banking, so it\\u2019s likely I\\u2019ll take a job in or near NYC. We are in our mid-20s, and we are both from the Midwest. We are looking for safe, walkable, and interesting places to live with a lot going on (good eats, drinks and shopping).\\n\\nIve looked into Jersey City and Hoboken, which look like they satisfy most of our criteria with the exception being cost of living. We both have cars, so parking is a major consideration for us. We\\u2019re also trying to understand if Newark would be a good place to live, but I\\u2019m getting a lot of mixed signals.\\n\\nAny advice is welcome. We are trying to plan a trip to fly out to visit in late January to get a feel for the potential neighborhoods.\",\n          \"Hi /r/newjersey!!  You guys are great.  Every time I come over here I enjoy reading stuff and just the general attitude around here.  So I\\u2019m hoping you guys can help me figure out where the hell to live.  I know how good specifics are, so I\\u2019ll tell you my weird oddities.\\n\\nSome general stuff: I\\u2019m gonna be 60 next year (ugh), have absolutely no interest in anything but a novel I\\u2019m writing (parties, night life, drinking, \\u201cactivities\\u201d\\u2014pretty much could care less\\u2014just want to write my novel on the train every day), I work a job in midtown that I love, and I work in the evenings, so I do a \\u201creverse commute\\u201d going into midtown every day in the middle of the afternoon, then come home after midnight. (That requires a lot of tricky logistics when it comes to trains, btw.)\\n\\nWhat I\\u2019m looking for is a town with a centralized, walkable downtown area, that is FLAT (think bicycling), and with services and stuff that I can walk to (until I can buy a car).  Also: trees.  Trees are a really big deal.  I have stupid medical problems like aversion to sunlight and almost instant heat exhaustion if it\\u2019s over 80\\u00ba, hence wanting and needing trees.  I visited 23 towns in NY, NJ, and CT last week, and the top three were Morristown, Madison, and Summit.  The Hudson Valley towns are too hilly for me, Westchester is too crammed and 1%er-ish brain dead (although I did like Pleasanton and Mamaroneck), and don\\u2019t get me started on the zombie CT commuter towns.  And no, buying is not an option.  I am fairly poor.\\n\\nSo my plan A would be to move to some cheap place in the middle of nowhere in a forest outside Denville or something, buy a car, and drive to work (although that would probably make me lonely as hell, a bigger and bigger problem as you get older past 60).  I absolutely LOVE to drive, and IF I did own a car my firm would PAY me to commute (for example, if I was to live 60 miles from my office, they would reimburse me $420.26/month to cover gas, tolls, and parking\\u2014yes I have a spreadsheet for that, because I\\u2019m a nerd).  Part of the reason I targeted the Morristown area was so that\\u2014were I driving to work every day\\u2014I would always be driving *away* from the sun, since I\\u2019d be heading east on I-80 (or the like) to the GWB every day.  But I don\\u2019t have the cash to move *and* buy a car at the same time, and I need to move sooner rather than later.\\n\\nI originally wanted to pay $1500/month rent\\u2014but then saw the prices of stuff.  So I decided to go up to $1800.  But that is pushing it.  If they end OT at my job, I\\u2019d only be able to save $500-700/month, which is a crap buffer.  I have a Morristown broker who\\u2019s cool and she\\u2019s sending me listings.  Unfortunately, my Maplewood broker who was going to search Summit listings for me was just in a car accident.\\n\\nMore stuff: I generally hate neighbors and especially their noise, like TV, dogs, etc.  So a building with thick walls is a must.  Even more so because I own a grand piano and play on weekends.  That can get loud.  It\\u2019s also a bear to move, and it needs to be in a sturdy, safe building.  I should be a great tenant theoretically because no pets or smoking EVER (incl 420) but landlords don\\u2019t seem to care about that.  I\\u2019m a little suspicious of the ultra-modern apt complexes so prevalent on bestrentnj.com\\u2026I\\u2019m pretty radical politically and usually don\\u2019t get along with typical folk.  Just readjusting to a car-dominated culture is going to be hard for me after living in NYC for 20 years.\\n\\nMorristown is a great vibe and mostly flat, but I think it\\u2019s growing too fast; and the distance makes the NJ train monthly pass $100 more.  Madison is cool, but there aren\\u2019t that many apartment units; and I think I might be too rowdy a personality for that town.  (Also: no cafe? What\\u2019s up with that?  Maybe it\\u2019s hidden.)  I only just learned about Summit, so I have yet to explore it.  But the fact that they decided to subsidize Uber rather than build a bigger parking lot at the train station seems pretty cool.  I read a long topic here recently about the snob level of Summit residents being through the roof, and I have to agree.  I had an encounter with a passive-aggressive dude in the Summit Library parking lot that was right out of Office Space.\\n\\nSo what are your thoughts about these three towns?  And do you think I should wait and get a car to give me more freedom and leverage in the home/town search?  And can you think of any other potential ideas town-wise (or otherwise\\u2014i.e., stuff \\u201coutside-the-box\\u201d)??  I luvvvvv snow, so one thing that would be great would be to live in that intense snow belt around Denville.  Or maybe PA.  But then\\u2026omg the loneliness (cue the Smiths or the Cure).  Too bad I\\u2019m not a dog person.\\n\\nHelp me, /r/newjersey \\u2026 the Brooklyn, it is killing me.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5454893558055993,\n        \"min\": -0.9991,\n        \"max\": 0.9993,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 390,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5668,\n          0.8963,\n          0.8738\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
